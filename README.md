# Detecting-Heart-Disease
Jupyter notebook detailing my approach to the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The aim of the project was to classify whether a patient suffered from heart disease based on predictors such as age, sex, cholesterol, etc. A number of machine learning models and feature selection techniques were evaluated. The assignment was completed for EE3020 'Engineering Applications of Machine Learning'. Final grade was 98%.
